▶mysong beta
==========

A Fork of the usual AMPP server... specially designed for DJ's to eliminate the need for people to walk up to request music.
▶mysong was created first as a project on a windows pc, and now is being built and maintained on a Raspberry pi. An SD card image will be available, as well as 
installers for many other linux distros.
